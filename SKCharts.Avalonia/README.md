## WIP


Simple implementation for 2D and 3D charts with SkiaSharp

For building the sample  

`dotnet build .\samples\Sample.csproj`


for running the sample __directly from current working directory__:  

`dotnet run --project .\samples\Sample.csproj` 



On top of the window, there is a menu with two item. One open the UserControl with a SKChart3D and some Sliders
The second opens the UserControl with a SKChart2D and one single Slider.

With sliders trigger real time manipulation - demostration.
